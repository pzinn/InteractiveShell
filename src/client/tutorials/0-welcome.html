  <h2>Getting started<!-- on web.macaulay2.com--></h2>

  <p>In this tutorial, we will show how to use this web site effectively.</p>

  <p>If you click on the yellow highlighted \(\mac\) code, the results of running
    those commands will be displayed in the right hand window. You may also
    type directly into the right hand window.</p>

  <p>
    For example, click on this yellow code to compute the factors of the
    given polynomial.
  </p>

  <code class='block'>R = QQ[x,y,z]</code>
  <code class='block'>F = (x-1)^3 - (y-1)^3</code>
  <code class='block'>factor F</code>

    <p>
  This code is evaluated by \(\mac\) on the server.  This means that
    you don't need to have \(\mac\) or any of its included packages installed
    on your computer.</p>

  <p>You are on the first page of this tutorial.  At the top of the
  window, you see how many pages are in this tutorial.  After you are
  finished with a page, click or tap on the right arrow icon.  You can
  also go back to previous pages of the tutorial by clicking on the
  left arrow button.</p>

  <p>Right now, please continue to the next page of the tutorial.</p>

  <h2>Getting Macaulay2 help on a topic</h2>

  <p>There are two main ways of getting help on a topic in \(\mac\).  The first method gives you
  text help in the \(\mac\) output window.  For example,</p>
  <p><code class='block'>help determinant</code></p>
  <p>This displays in the \(\mac\) output window how to use the function "determinant".
  <b>Note!</b> In many browsers, you will have scroll bars to go back, but in some, notably most versions
  of Safari, the scrollbars are there but hidden!
  </p>

  <p>Alternatively, and more usefully, you may obtain the web version by using:</p>
  <p><code class='block'>viewHelp determinant</code></p>

  <p>This opens the documentation page in the <b>Browse</b> tab.  You can surf through the links
  there to see other \(\mac\) documentation. When you are ready to come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the
    <b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page.  You will end up right here! </p>

  <p>In either case, you can click on the example code, then press Return, to run them yourself. Try to compute
    the determinant of the example $2\times 2$ matrix $M$ this way!</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h2>Using the terminal and the Editor window</h2>

    <p> You can type in \(\mac\) commands directly into the right hand side terminal.
      You have various options to execute again past input:
      <ul>
	<li>You can click on it, possibly edit it further, then press Return;</li>
	<li>You can select the bar on the left of its cell, then press Return;</li>
	<li>You can use the up and down arrow keys to go through the list of previous inputs;</li>
	<li>You can type the beginning of the line, then press the right arrow key for auto-completion.</li>
      </ul>
      You can also use the tab key for \(\mac\) keyword auto-completion.</p>

    <h2>Using the Editor window on the left</h2>
  <p>When you write M2 functions or long loops, it is often more convenient to write your code
    in a separate window and execute the code after you wrote it. This allows you to easily modify previous code and 
    move the cursor around freely.</p> 
    
    <p>Clicking or tapping the <b>Editor</b> button at the top of the page, navigates you to the Input Window.
  This is where you may type in \(\mac\) code and have it evaluated.</p>
 
   <p>In that window, place your cursor on a line that you wish to evaluate, and either click the
  <b>Evaluate</b> button, or press Shift-Return (both keys at the same time).</p>

  <p>Alternatively, you may select several lines, or a part of a line, and clicking
  <b>Evaluate</b> (or press Shift-Return) will evaluate the selection.</p>

  <p>You try it!  Click <b>Editor</b>, type in some \(\mac\) input, or try out some of the example
  lines already there. To come back to the tutorial, click or tap on the
  <b>Tutorial</b> button at the top of the page. </p>

  <h2>Macaulay2 sessions and the Reset button</h2>
  
  <p> When your browser starts, it starts a \(\mac\) process on our server.
  All of your input, either typed and evaluated, or run by pressing buttons,
  goes to this process.  If you open a second window or tab in the same
  browser, you will get the same session.
  </p>

  <p>
  You might wish to start fresh, or restart \(\mac\), if a computation is
  going on too long.  In this case, press the <b>Reset</b> button at the top of
  the page.
  </p>

  <p>
  When you first connect to this web site, a cookie is generated, and that is used to connect to
  your \(\mac\) process on the server.  If you quit your browser, and it is set to remember windows, then
  it remembers the cookie, and you can reconnect back to the same session.  If not, then a new session
  is created.
  </p>

  <p>
  Sometimes the server must be restarted for maintenance or other reasons, and at those times, all sessions
  are terminated.
  </p>

    <h2>Loading/Saving your work</h2>
  
   <p>
  Click on the <b>Load</b> and <b>Save</b> buttons at the top right of the editor tab to transfer the contents of a local file to the editor, and vice versa.
  </p>

</div>

<div>
  <h2>Advanced topics</h2>
  <h2>Uploading files</h2>

  <p>Use the <b>Upload File</b> button to upload files to the \(\mac\) server that can then be loaded into your \(\mac\) session. Suppose that you have uploaded a file named \(\verb|foo.m2|\) which contains \(\mac\) code.
  You may then load this file into \(\mac\) using either:
  </p>
  
  <p><code class='block'>load "foo.m2"</code></p>

  <p>
  or, if you wish to see all of the lines executed one by one:
  </p>
  
  <p><code class='block'>input "foo.m2"</code></p>

  
  <p><b>Note</b>: these lines will likely give errors now, as the file
    \(\verb|foo.m2|\) probably doesn't exist on the server!</p>

  <p>For your convenience, when you load or save files to the editor, they are automatically uploaded as well.
    You can turn off this feature by toggling "auto upload" in the editor tab.</p>

  <h2>Running shell commands in your Macaulay2 session</h2>

  <p>It is possible to run shell commands from within \(\mac\), although many operations are restricted.
  For example, to see what files you have in your home directory on the server, try:</p>
  <p><code class='block'>run "ls -a"</code></p><br/>
  Alternatively, if you want to obtain the output as a string, use
  <p><code class='block'>get "!ls -a"</code></p>

  <h2>Macaulay2 and temporary files</h2>

  <p>Sometimes \(\mac\) or one of its packages generate temporary files.
  For example, the graph function below creates dot and svg files.
  </p>
    <p><code class='block'>needsPackage "Graphs"</code></p>
    <p><code class='block'>A = graph({{a,b},{b,c},{b,d},{d,e}})</code></p>

  <h2>Getting files back to your machine</h2>

  <p>
  Sometimes your \(\mac\) code will create a file as output.  How to download
  this onto your machine?  Here is one way.  This first line creates a file for
  the purpose of this example.<br/>
  
  <code class='block'>"important-results.txt" << "very important results" << close</code>  </p>

  <p>The next line will open the file in your <b>Browse</b> tab.<br/>
  <code class='block'>show URL "important-results.txt"</code></p>

  <h2>Restrictions in place for the Macaulay2 server</h2>

  <p>The server is being shared with other users, therefore memory and CPU time
  are limited (generous, but limited).  Other restrictions include: upload file size, number of processes that
  can run, and the amount of time that the session is saved on the server.
